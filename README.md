# Harmoney - **Gamers Heaven**
Harmoney is an app created by @ChezyName, for the sole purpose of recreating discord in a likeable way. This app give the user full control over every aspect of the app, dislike it? make a spin off of the app with the [full source code available here.](https://github.com/ChezyName/Harmoney)
The full apps code is available, you just need to place in your firebase SDK information, there is a tutorial below for anyone who wants to create their own version of the app.
Customizability does not end there, we have worked hard on adding full Theme support. There are 4 built-in themes created by me, Dark - The normal theme for everyone whos normal, Light - 'Flashbang', Midnight / Moody Blues - think jazzzz, and Last but not least, ~~Google~~ I **MEAN** carrot, I don't have the rights for that 'word', anyways...
Carrot - idk I took ~~Google's~~ Colors. Harmony, give users full data privacy because its open-source, you can legit remove anything fishy yourself!

## Custom Themes
Custom themes are one of the greatest things to be added to Harmoney. the endless possibility to change anything you dislike of the color scheme without making the app using your own firebase SDK.

Either you can start from scratch or use the template below, id recommend using the template as in *Visual Studio Code* you can 

```
:root{

--backgroundPrimary: #222;

--backgroundSecondary: #333;

  

--text: #fff;

  

--outlines: #111;

  

--interactble: #444;

--interactbleHover: #556;

  

--topBarPrimary: #222;

--topBarSecondary: #333;

  

--topbarButtons: #111;

--topbarButtonsHover: #333;

  

--topbarCloseHover: #912;

  

--scrollMain: #334;

--scrollScnd: #112;

}
```
